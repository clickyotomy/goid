goid
----

Package "goid" provides a way to retrieve the runtime ID of
the current goroutine from its thread local storage (TLS).

The function "Get()" retrieves the ID of the calling goroutine.
If an architecture-specific assembly routine is defined, it is
called, otherwise a fallback (slow) implementation is used to
get the same information.

It should be noted that the runtime intentionally avoids
providing an interface to expose the goroutine ID. From [1]:

> Goroutines do not have names; they are just anonymous workers.
> They expose no unique identifier, name, or data structure to
> the programmer.
